WHO WE ARE
We are bible based church of believers, seeking to actively live out our faith as we love God and love one another.

WHAT WE BELIEVE

GOD’S GRACE – We are saved by Grace through faith in the person and work of Jesus Christ on the cross. We continue to enjoy a relationship of intimacy with God as we grow in Him. The gospel is good news.

LIFESTYLE – A Christian life contained within church walls makes mockery of Jesus command to share the good news with others. We believe that what we enjoy when we meet together should be shared with those around us.

THE HOLY SPIRIT – we believe in the Person and Ministry of the Holy Spirit for TODAY and want to host Him well in our lives and meetings.

There is only one true God who is the eternal King, Creator and Redeemer of all. We believe in the Trinity and that God has revealed Himself to be eternally self-existent – one being in three persons: God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit.

We affirm the Bible to be the inspired and only infallible and authoritative Word of God.

We believe in the sanctifying and enabling work of the Holy Spirit. The baptism of the Holy Spirit according to Acts 1:4-8 and 2:4 is poured out on believers that they might have power and boldness to be witnesses.

We believe in the glorious visible return of our Lord Jesus Christ for His ‘blood-bought’ bride – His church. Scripture teaches that heaven and hell are real places and we rejoice that in Christ we have a certainty in our eternal salvation.
