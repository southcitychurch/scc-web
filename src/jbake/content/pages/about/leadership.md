Jesus Christ is the Head of His church!

The Bible reveals that leadership is part of the fabric of local church.

Local churches were autonomous and elders working in team together both govern the affairs of the church and pastor the people under their care.

The vision of the leadership within South City Church, is to see believers in Dublin city cared for, taught the Word of God, encouraged, equipped to walk by the Holy Spirit, impactful in their spheres of influence for the Kingdom of God, loving God and loving one another
